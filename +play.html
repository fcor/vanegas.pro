      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Develop the website</strong></p></li>
        <li class="li-last"><p><strong>Load many assets without affecting performance</strong></p></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>UI process</h3>
      <p>Our first step in every project is to organize all the info and generate the IA (information 
        arquitecture). Then with this info we define each screen for the website and this is were we 
        start our wireframing process. <br> <br>
        In this process we just use pen and paper to define the structure of the web page, based in 
        the collected information. This step is were we create the <strong>structure</strong> of the site.
      </p>
      <div class="project-img">
      <img src="images/play-1.png" alt="" width="774">
      </div>
      <h3>Digitalizing the wireframes</h3>
      <p>In this step we just clean up the wireframes to get closer to the final structure.</p>
      <div class="project-img">
        <img src="images/play-2.png" alt="" width="774">
      </div>
      <h3>Foundations</h3>
      <p>+Play's team provided us their foundations, they defined the fonts and colors that we need
        to use in their website. Finally we can merge all this things with the assets provided by +Play
         to create the mock up and start making the website´s look and feel.
      </p>
      <div class="project-img">
        <img src="images/play-3.png" alt=""  width="774">
      </div>
      <h3>Assets loading</h3>
      <p>In all this process until the mockups were done, I talked a lot with the developer to 
        understand what things we can and can’t do. Both of us identified that the video assets 
        were too heavy for the website, so we needed to find a solution for this problem. At first,
         we thought using gifs directly, but we immediately found that this approach had many issues. 
         Gif files doesn't have good quality, are not performant on some devices and using classic 
         image html element didn't provide us full control over the media files and that would be a 
         problem for the mobile version. We ended up using mp4 files with <strong>html 5 video</strong> and optimizing 
         them using <strong>ffmpeg</strong>. This solution wouldn't be possible without working closely with the developer.
         We use the <strong>lazy loading</strong> technique to just load the image that the user is viewing.  
        </p>
      <h3>Responsive design</h3>
      <p>The client and us were pretty happy with the final result, you can see the result here:
